# Binary-Serach-Using-Javascript


Binary Search is a Search Algorithm to find a specific element located in an Array (ONLY works with Sorted Arrays).


Sample array:
var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9];
var targetValue = 4

Expected Output:

when you invoke the function - binary_Search(array, targetValue)
Output: 3 (index of targetValue is returned)
